# Simulating Population Genetics with RShiny
This webapp explores population genetics through a series of interactive simulations, inspired by my summer course work at University of Oxford. 
In the first section, I will introduced a simple and interactive model of directional selection, later improving upon our model by introducing Fisherian polygenic inheritance with a similar interactive simulation. 
The second section explores how long it takes for a neutral mutation to reach fixity with a given allele frequency and population size, following in the footsteps of Kimura and Ohta. 
The goal of this project is to dig deeper into canonical results in population genetics, using simulation to illustrate interesting results, answer complex questions, and verify analytical solutions.
